# 👋 Hi there! I'm Sebastián Serra

Welcome to my GitHub space — where data meets curiosity and a bit of tactical football flair ⚽.

I'm an **Applied Mathematician** and current Master's student in **Statistics and Operations Research** (UPC & UB, Barcelona), with deep roots in **Bayesian modeling**, **AI**, and **Sport Analytics**. I love turning complex problems into structured models — whether it’s player scouting, pricing gas stations, optimizing risk, or deploying RAG pipelines with embeddings.

## 🚀 What you’ll find here

This repository is a growing collection of projects where math meets meaning. You’ll see topics like:

- 📊 **Bayesian Statistics**: hierarchical models, latent variable inference, ZINB models, MCMC, and predictive simulations.
- 🧠 **AI & Modern NLP**:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) for domain-specific QA.
  - Vector databases, custom **embeddings**, and LLM orchestration.
  - Application of **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, **ChromaDB** in Streamlit dashboards.
- ⚽ **Sport Analytics**:
  - Tactical models using latent space embeddings.
  - Automated **scouting reports** for agencies and clubs.
  - Match simulations and ball-possession dynamics.
- 💰 **Finance & Pricing**:
  - Bayesian pricing models for gas stations and risk.
  - Predictive salary and insurance coverage analytics.
- 📈 **Machine Learning & Statistical Learning**:
  - Decision trees, ensemble models, clustering, supervised/unsupervised pipelines.
  - Feature engineering and explainability.
- 🔧 **Optimization & Dynamical Systems**:
  - Non-linear numerical optimization.
  - Use of dynamical systems for predictive modeling.
- 🧬 **Graph Theory & Latent Spaces**:
  - Rivalry graphs in football.
  - Dimensionality reduction & representation learning.
- 🛠️ **Deployment & Tooling**:
  - Streamlit apps with custom themes and persistent memory.
  - Full-stack R/Python pipelines for interactive analytics.

## 💼 About me

- **Senior Data Scientist** at **IBM/bluetab** (for **BBVA**) — creating Bayesian and ML models for pricing, siniestrality, and risk management. Also active with **Datio** tech stack (Spark, Databricks, Bitbucket, etc.).
- **Scouting Product Manager** at **Aztec Data Hub** — building data solutions for football clubs across the globe, from **Sevilla FC** and **Atlético Mineiro** to **Oakland Roots**.
- **Data Science Intern** at **NTT Data**, working on banking analytics projects: developing Streamlit dashboards for financial wallets, automating PDF extraction with AI agents, and optimizing fraud detection processes using SAS.
- **Data Analyst at Danone**, working on compensation models, and **Junior Data Scientist at Gaspre**, optimizing fuel prices.

I’ve presented my research at **SIAM**, earned 2nd place in the **Aztec Summit Hackathon**, and completed my thesis on **latent space estimation in football tactics** in collaboration with **FC Barcelona Innovation Hub**.
